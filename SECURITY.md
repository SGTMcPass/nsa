## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Security Announcements

### Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through our security advisory process:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Instead, report it by emailing [SECURITY_EMAIL] with a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3. Include the following information in your report:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - The impact of the vulnerability
   - Any potential mitigations

Our security team will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report.

### Disclosure Policy

- When the security team receives a security bug report, the issue will be assigned a primary handler.
- The team will confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- The team will audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Fixes will be prepared for the latest stable version and any supported LTS versions.
- The fix will be reviewed and tested before being released.

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1).

### Security Best Practices

To enhance the security of your implementation:

1. Always use the latest stable version of the library.
2. Follow the principle of least privilege when setting up API keys and permissions.
3. Never commit sensitive information (API keys, tokens, etc.) to version control.
4. Validate and sanitize all inputs to the library.
5. Keep your dependencies up to date.

### Security Considerations

This project follows these security best practices:

- Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities
- Secure coding practices and code reviews
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Clear documentation of security-relevant features and configurations
