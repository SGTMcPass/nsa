## Code Style and Standards

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
- Use type hints for all function signatures and variables.
- Write docstrings following the [Google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
- Keep lines under 88 characters (Black's default).
- Use `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes.

### Pre-commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality. They will run automatically before each commit. To install:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Run tests locally before submitting a PR:
  ```bash
  make test
  ```
- Aim for good test coverage (90%+).

## Documentation

- Update documentation when adding new features or changing behavior.
- Document all public APIs with docstrings.
- Keep the README and other documentation up to date.
