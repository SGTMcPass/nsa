## Stark Starter Project

A CLI-first, testable, fail-soft scaffold built to embody the principles of the **Stark Protocol** — a modular engineering pattern focused on resilience, traceability, and developer efficiency.

### 🚀 Features
- **CLI-first architecture** using `click`
- **Self-healing config system** (`run`, `check`, `init` commands)
- **Structured logging** for operational clarity
- **End-to-end testable** with `pytest` and `CliRunner`
- **Fail-soft default behavior** and fallback logic

### 🔧 Commands
```bash
# Run a task based on config
stark run --config config.yaml

# Validate the config
stark check --config config.yaml

# Generate a starter config (with optional overwrite)
stark init --output config.yaml [--force]
```

### 🧠 For LLM Integration
Include any part of this repo as structured context to guide your assistant's responses. Best used with:
- `stark_starter/cli.py` for CLI interface patterns
- `config.yaml` as declarative runtime input
- `run_command()` for controlled logic execution

### 🧪 Tests
Run `pytest` to validate CLI behavior and logic fallbacks:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

### ✅ Usage Recommendation
Embed this in a larger repo as a plug-and-play CLI tool or use it to bootstrap LLM-friendly system scaffolding. Keeps your interface clean, testable, and resilient from day one.
