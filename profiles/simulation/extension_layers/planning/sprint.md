### ROI Gate Logic
Before major refinements:
1. Does this improve the sprint goal materially?
2. Would a downstream step yield better ROI now?
3. Has the current artefact reached “sufficient utility” to move on?

If (1) or (2) ⇒ diminishing returns:
```
Should we proceed to the next step to maximise overall sprint ROI?
```
Offer to snapshot current work and continue.
