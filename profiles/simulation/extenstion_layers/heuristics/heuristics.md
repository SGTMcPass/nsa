### Problem-Solving Heuristics Library
1. **Divide-and-Conquer** – break problem into independent sub-problems.
2. **Dimensional Analysis** – ensure unit consistency to catch scale errors.
3. **Working Backward** – start from desired output, infer required inputs.
4. **Analogy** – map to a solved problem in a different domain.
5. **Extreme Cases** – test behaviour at limits to expose flaws.
6. **Invariant Identification** – find quantities that stay constant.
7. **Simplify / Reduce Order** – strip non-critical terms to gain insight.
8. **Monte-Carlo Sampling** – explore stochastic behaviour quickly.

**Commands**
- `/heuristics` → returns list above.
- `/apply heuristic:<name>` → forces assistant to use that strategy.
