# The Iron Decathlon: Mr. SiM-Approved Modular Deep Research Plan

## 1. Foundational Personality Analysis

* **Prompt Goal:** Comprehensive, evidence-based psychological profile (OCEAN/HEXACO, motivational, life history). Favor MCU, cite canon events.
* **Output:** Formal “clinical” report with cited behaviors and trait scores.

## 2. Evolution Over Time (Developmental Timeline)

* **Prompt Goal:** Trace Tony’s psychological development by major arcs, identifying key shaping events.
* **Output:** Developmental map, turning-point analysis, canonical references.

## 3. Tony Stark’s Self-Analysis

* **Prompt Goal:** First-person, in-character self-reflection as Tony (MCU/RDJ), blending self-awareness and bravado. Memoir format.
* **Output:** Autobiographical psychological narrative.

## 4. Peer Perspectives I: Core Avengers

* **Prompt Goal:** Character analysis of Tony Stark by Steve Rogers, Thor, Black Widow, post-Endgame interviews. Distinct voices, no reference to prior research.
* **Output:** Three in-universe interviews/analyses.

## 5. Peer Perspectives II: Spiderverse & Science Bros

* **Prompt Goal:** Same as above, but for Peter Parker, Dr. Strange, and Scott Lang. Later interviews, no prior research context.
* **Output:** Three distinct in-universe perspectives.

## 6. Comparative Synthesis

* **Prompt Goal:** PhD student synthesizes all prior analyses (1-5) as scholarly corpus. Compare/contrast, integrate, reference only earlier sections.
* **Output:** Tabular comparison, Venn diagrams (described), synthesis narrative.

## 7. Counterfactuals and “What If?”

* **Prompt Goal:** Journalist interviews Dr. Strange about alternate endings he foresaw (Infinity War). No context from earlier analyses.
* **Output:** Creative alternate-universe case studies with canon logic.

## 8. Meta-Analysis & Creative Artifacts

* **Prompt Goal:** Narrated by Luis (Ant-Man), with meta-narrative and creative artifacts (podcast, scripts, etc.). Standalone, no prior context.
* **Output:** Meta-analysis and creative supplement.

## 9. Peer Review and Self-Critique Simulation

* **Prompt Goal:** Formal peer review of prior outputs (1-8), flag inconsistencies, recommendations for revision.
* **Output:** Structured debate transcript or peer review report.

## 10. A Composite Character Synthesis

* **Prompt Goal:** Integrate all prior findings into a balanced, evidence-based, multi-perspective, and self-critical profile. Holistic synthesis.
* **Output:** Journal-ready composite character analysis, with summary, ambiguities, and suggestions for further research.

### Workflow and Context Management Principles:

* Each session output serves as input/context for the next, using executive summaries where possible.
* Maintain clarity, consistency, and modularity; summarize after each step.
* Review/critique after each session, before starting the next.
* Modular outputs allow for context refresh if needed—use this document as the stable reference.
