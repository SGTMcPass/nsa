# Iron Decathlon: The Multiverse Tony Stark Character Analysis Project

---

## Project Overview

The Iron Decathlon is an ambitious, modular project to conduct the most comprehensive, multi-perspective, and narratively rich character analysis of Tony Stark (Iron Man) ever attempted. We blend rigorous psychological, historical, and literary analysis with creative, in-universe voices for a research experience as inventive as Stark Industries itself. All primary canon is welcome (MCU, comics, animation), with a strong MCU emphasis.

## Project Workflow

1. **Create & Update Sections:**
   Each main file contains prompt, output, and self-reflection for its respective sections. Use executive summaries for continuity.

2. **Maintain Master Index:**
   Update `master_index.md` after each session with a summary, author/voice, and link.

3. **Context Management:**
   **Strictly prohibit** using context from outside this project’s workspace or other ChatGPT projects/sessions.
   *All creativity and analysis must originate from within these project files and instructions.*

4. **Section Hand-offs:**
   When a section references prior work, use only executive summaries or narrative handoff sentences—never full outputs unless essential.

5. **Canon Documentation:**
   Document all MCU/comic citations and specialized terms in `canon_references.md` for consistency.

6. **Review & Archiving:**
   Regularly review file usage and archive older content externally if you approach the workspace file limit.

7. **Creative/Bonus Features:**
   Optional section challenges, in-world quotes, and subtle “Easter eggs” are encouraged—just ensure clarity and workflow are maintained.

8. **Jarvis Protocol Failsafe:**
   *If project chaos exceeds safe limits, activate the Jarvis Protocol: full audit and context cleanup are authorized immediately.
   (For actionable steps, see instructions.md.)*

## Section Openers
