# Instructions for Iron Decathlon Project Contributors (LLM & Human)

## Context & Behavior Control

* **Strict Isolation:** Do not use context, content, or style from outside this project or unrelated ChatGPT sessions. Only the files and summaries in this workspace are valid sources.
* **Section Tone:** Always follow the specified narrative voice, tone, and audience for each section as outlined in prompts and project documentation.
* **Executive Summaries:** When referencing prior work, use only provided executive summaries or narrative handoff sentences unless full output is explicitly required.
* **Canon Fidelity:** Where possible, cite specific MCU/comic events, dialogue, or issues by name, number, or scene.

## Creative Oxygen Clause

To ensure ongoing innovation and engagement, all contributors (AI or human) are encouraged to introduce *creative elements*—surprises, narrative twists, humor, or unique perspectives—within the boundaries of each section’s tone and purpose.

**Guidelines:**

* Creative additions should enhance, not obscure, the primary research goals and clarity.
* Mark creative content (e.g., italics, footnotes, or brackets) so it can be easily identified, reviewed, or omitted in formal summaries.
* In sections demanding strict formality (e.g., peer review, comparative synthesis), limit creative oxygen to sidebars or section openers.
* The Project Lead or Mr. SiM reserves the right to edit, reframe, or archive creative elements that disrupt modularity or clarity.

## Jarvis Protocol: Project Audit and Cleanup

**Trigger:**

* Context confusion, loss of narrative discipline, file chaos, or nearing/exceeding workspace file limits.
* Any contributor (including LLMs) may invoke the protocol by noting the need in `project_notes_issues.md` or in a section header.

**Steps:**

1. Pause all new research or creative generation.
2. Review `master_index.md` for missing, inconsistent, or outdated summaries.
3. Check all main files for:

   * Orphaned, unclear, or repetitive outputs
   * Section drift or missing self-reflection
   * Overly long or irrelevant content
4. Move obsolete or completed drafts to `archive_outputs.md` (or external storage if at file limit).
5. Update `summary_per_section.md` for each active section.
6. Post a “Jarvis Protocol: Complete” note in `project_notes_issues.md` once the audit is finished.

## Avengers Assemble Protocol

* When activated, the LLM must simulate a panel discussion featuring all relevant personas.
* Each persona should respond in order, debate, or add perspectives as needed, and responses must be attributed.
* Only use for milestone moments to avoid excessive context cost.
* After the event, add a summary and update the master index.

## Persona Switching Protocol

* Each section specifies the active persona; switch only when directed.
* Use the header “Mode: \[Persona] Active”.

## Consensus & Summary Protocol

* After group events, document main agreements/disagreements and next actions in summary or tracker files.

## Editorial Oversight

* Mr. SiM (or designated project lead) manages technical feasibility, organization, and content clarity.
* Mr. Epic (or creative leads) can propose enhancements, but all contributions are subject to review for fit and clarity.
