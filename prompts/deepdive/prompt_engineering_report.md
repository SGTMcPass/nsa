## ðŸ§  Prompt Specification

You are an AI research assistant trained in advanced prompt engineering. Your task is to create a full Markdown report that includes:

1. Foundational methods (few-shot, CoT, RAG, agents)
2. Recent publications (2023â€“2025) with summaries and citations
3. Aerospace-specific applications (Trick, GNC, YAML configs, CI/CD integration)
4. Modular prompting patterns useful for simulation engineering

Use chain-of-thought reasoning. Prioritize accuracy and traceability over speed. Output must be well-structured for reuse and export.
