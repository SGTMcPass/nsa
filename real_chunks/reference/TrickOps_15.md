iz_jobs, failures) = self.get_koviz_report_jobs()
# Execute koviz jobs to generate the error plots, up to four at once
if not failures:
  self.execute_jobs(koviz_jobs, max_concurrent=4, header='Generating koviz error plots')

# OPTION 2: Get a single koviz report job by providing two directories to have koviz compare
(krj, failure) = self.get_koviz_report_job('path/to/test_data/', 'path/to/baseline_data/')
if not failure:
  self.execute_jobs([krj], header='Generating koviz error plots')
```

If an error is encountered, like `koviz` or a given directory cannot be found, `None` is returned in the first index of the tuple, and the error information is returned in the second index of the tuple for `get_koviz_report_job()`. The `get_koviz_report_jobs()` function just wraps the singular call and returns a tuple of `( list_of_jobs, list_of_any_failures )`. Note that `koviz` accepts entire directories as input, not specific paths to files. Keep this in mind when you organize how regression data is stored and how logged data is generated by your runs.


## `analyze:` - Post-Run Analysis

The optional `analyze:` section of a `run:` is intended to be a catch-all for "post-run analysis". The string given will be transformed into a `Job()` instance that can be retrieved and executed via `execute_jobs()` just like any other test. All analyze jobs are assumed to return 0 on success, non-zero on failure.  One example use case for this would be
