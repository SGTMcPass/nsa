 the array. After
# the Monte Carlo Generation Model executes, the resulting RUNs can be queued

# Slurm: https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html

# $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID is automatically provided by slurm, and will be an
# integer between 0-99 per the "SBATCH --array" flag specified at the top of
# this script
echo "SLURM has provided us with array job integer: $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"
# Convert this integer to a zero-padded string matching the RUN naming
# convention associated with thi

The above script can be executed within a SLURM environment by running `sbatch <path/to/script.sh>`. This single command will create 100 independent array jobs in SLURM, allowing the scheduler to execute them as resources permit.  Be extra careful with the zero-padding logic in the script above.  The monte-carlo generation model will create zero-padded `RUN` names suitable for the number of runs requested to be generated by the user. The `%02d` part of the script above specifies 2-digit zero-padding which is suitable for 100 runs. Be sure to match this
