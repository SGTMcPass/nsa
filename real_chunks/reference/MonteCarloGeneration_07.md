 to the right of that
symbol will be assigned to this variable.

* MonteCarloPythonLineExec provides a line of executable Python code that can be used to compute the value of this
variable. So rather than generating an assignment statement, e.g.

```
var_x = 5
```

when the MonteCarloMaster processes an instance of this class, it will use a character string to generate an
instruction statement, e.g.

```
var_x = math.sin(2 * math.pi * object.circle_fraction)
```

(in this case, the character string would be “math.sin(2 * math.pi * object.circle_fraction)” and
object.circle_fraction could be a previously-dispersed variable).

   A particularly useful application of this capability is in generating systematic data sweeps across a domain, as
opposed to random distributions within a domain. These are commonly implemented as a for-loop, but we can use
the MonteCarloPythonLineExec to generate them internally. The first data assignment made in each file is to a
run-number, which can be used as an index. The example shown below will generate a sweep across the domain
[20,45) in steps of 2.5.

```
object.sweep_variable = (monte_carlo.master.monte_run_number % 10) * 2.5 + 20
```

   * MonteCarloPythonFileExec is used when simple assignments and one-line instructions are insufficient, such as
when one generated-value that feeds into an analytical algorithm to generate multiple other values. With this class,
the execution of the Python file generated by MonteCarloMaster will hit a call to execute a file as specified by this
class
