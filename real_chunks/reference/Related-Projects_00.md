## Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (SRMS)

In the early 1990s, the Software, Robotics, and Simulation Division (ER) at the NASA Johnson Space Center developed Trick as a framework to support operational performance evaluations of the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (also known as Canadarm). The SRMS simulation allowed engineers to prototype and test SRMS flight software, perform dynamic load analysis, and assisted in both ground and in-flight training. SRMS hardware-in-the-loop simulations are used in both the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) and the Multi-Use Remote Manipulator Development Facility (MRMDF).

The Systems Engineering Simulator (SES) is a real-time, crew-in-the-loop engineering simulator for the space station and other advanced programs. The SES allows NASA engineers to physically model a given Trick simulation and provides a more realistic working environment for training astronauts. The SES has been used to create training environments for space shuttle simulations, SR
