/input.py:
        compare:
          - path/to/SIM_ball/RUN_test/log_a.csv vs. regression/SIM_ball/log_a.csv
          - path/to/SIM_ball/RUN_test/log_b.trk vs. regression/SIM_ball/log_b.trk
```
In this example, `SIM_ball`'s run `RUN_foo/input.py` doesn't have any comparisons, but `RUN_test/input.py` contains two comparisons, each of which compares data generated by the execution of `RUN_test/input.py` to a stored off version of the file under the `regression/` directory relative to the top level of the project. The comparisons themselves can be executed in your python script via the `compare()` function in multiple ways. For example:

```python
# Assuming we're in a python script using TrickWorkflow as a base class and RUN_test/input.py
# has already been executed locally so that logged data exists on disk...

# OPTION 1: Execute compare() at the top level of TrickWorkflow
ret = self.compare()          # Execute all comparisons for all runs across all sims

# OPTION 2: Get the sim you care about and execute compare() on only that sim
s = self.get_sim('SIM_ball')  # Get the sim we care about
ret = s.compare()             # Execute all comparisons for all runs in 'SIM_ball'

# OPTION 3: Get the run you care about and execute compare() at the run level
r = self.get_sim('SIM_ball').get_run('RUN_test/input.py')
ret = r.compare()             # Execute all comparisons for run 'RUN_test/input.py'
```

In all three of these options, `ret` will
