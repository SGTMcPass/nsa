# TrickOps

TrickOps is shorthand for "Trick Operations". TrickOps is a `python3` framework that provides an easy-to-use interface for common testing and workflow actions that Trick simulation developers and users often run repeatedly.  Good software developer workflows typically have a script or set of scripts that the developer can run to answer the question "have I broken anything?".  The purpose of TrickOps is to provide the logic central to managing these tests while allowing each project to define how and and what they wish to test. Don't reinvent the wheel, use TrickOps!
