-in-the-loop engineering simulator for the space station and other advanced programs. The SES allows NASA engineers to physically model a given Trick simulation and provides a more realistic working environment for training astronauts. The SES has been used to create training environments for space shuttle simulations, SRMS simulations, ISS simulations, and Mars rover simulations, among others.

## Virtual Reality Laboratory

The Virtual Reality Laboratory is an immersive training facility that provides real-time graphics and motion simulators integrated with a tendon-driven robotic device to provide the kinesthetic sensation of the mass and inertia characteristics of large objects. A virtual 3D technical mockup of the ISS allows training astronauts to experience '0G' movement while seated.
