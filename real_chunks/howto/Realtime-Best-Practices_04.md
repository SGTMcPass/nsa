The first line of the record indicates that **some** job started at time=0.000026 seconds. It's not until the second line of the record that you find that the start time (0.000026) refers to the job with ID=16.01. The third line in the record indicates that the job with ID=16.01 stopped at 0.000027. The fourth line redundantly conveys that **some** job stopped at 0.000027. (I told you it was weird.)

To match the job ID's with the job names, see the ```S_job_execution``` file.

### Analyzing the Frame Log Files
There are several ways we can examine/ analyze the data logged in these files.

#### [trick-DP](https://nasa.github.io/trick/tutorial/ATutPlottingData)
When you build your Trick sim, the following data-product files are created for you to plot your sim's frame log data.

* ```DP_rt_frame.xml```
* ```DP_rt_timeline.xml```
* ```DP_rt_timeline_init.xml```
* ```DP_rt_trickjobs.xml```
* ```DP_rt_userjobs.xml```

#### [koviz](https://github.com/nasa/koviz)
**koviz** Is an open-source project for plotting Trick data-recording files. It's particularly good for Monte Carlo data plotting. It also has a nifty feature for processing frame-log files. Not only can it plot them, but ```% koviz -rt RUN_directory``` will generate a report that will list the top 10 spikes in your frame log.

**TIP:**`` ```trick_real_time.rt_sync.rt_monitor``` (the Trick realtime monitor) should show the max job time. If not, you might have problems to solve.

### Other Useful Files Generated by a Trick Sim Run

| Name | Desscription|
|:-----|:------------|
|```RUN_*/S_job_execution```| Lists the simulation jobs by Name, Job ID, Trick Thread ID (PID) Job class, Phase, Start time, Stop time, Cycle, and whether the job is enabled.|
|```RUN_*/S_run_summary ```|(Should be called build_summary) - Documents the name and path of the executable and the input file, the build time of the simulation executable, and the Trick version. It also contains the list of environment variables used when the simulation was built and the model versions.|
|```RUN_*/send_hs ```|the end of this file contains run statistics that may be useful.|
