# Introduction
This document will walk you through the process of installing Trick on your computer. Please read each section carefully.

# Package Dependencies
Trick requires various free third party utilities in order to function. All the following products are used by Trick and may already be installed as part of your OS distribution. **Install any missing dependencies with your operating system's [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager).** For most operating systems, the default version of a dependency will be compatitable with Trick. **We strongly recommend that you use your package manager's default versions if they meet Trick's requirements.** Please check the specific OS instructions below for your operating system for more details.
