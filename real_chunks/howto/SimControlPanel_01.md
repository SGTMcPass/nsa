##### Simulation Overruns
The Sim Control Panel shows which simulation is running and keeps count of its overruns.

##### Status Message Panel
This panel is where any error or status messaging for the simulation appears. The search bar at the bottom allows the user to find specific text within the panel.

##### Simulation Connection
The bottom part of the Sim Control Panel has a dropdown where the user can input the hostname and port number of the simulation to which the user is attempting to connect. The hostname and port number must be separated by either a space or a colon. The user can also use the dropdown menu to select a simulation. The Connect button next to the dropdown initiates the connection attempt.
