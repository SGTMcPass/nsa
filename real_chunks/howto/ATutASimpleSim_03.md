### A Simple (non-Trick) Simulation > Cannonball Problem Statement > Limitations of the Simulation

 run our simulation in real-time? That is, if
we want to be able to synchronize simulation-time with "wall clock" time.

* What if we want to interact with our simulation while its running?

* What if we want to record the data produced by our simulation over time?

In the next section, we'll see how a Trick simulation goes together, and how it helps us to easily integrate user-supplied simulation models with commonly needed simulation capabilites.
