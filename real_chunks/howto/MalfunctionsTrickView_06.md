 window.

#### File Menu
You can select Save Event from the File Menu if you want to save your newly created event to a file. If you don't do this, it will be lost once you quit MTV or when your connected simulation terminates.

Currently there is no way to Load Event(s) from a file into the MTV editor. It is strictly for creating new events from scratch.

#### Edit Menu
##### Create New Event
If you select Create New Event from the Edit Menu, any editing you've done that is currently displayed under Event Syntax and User Data will be discarded, and the Event Name will be set to "put_new_event_name_here" where you must enter a new Event Name string to continue.

##### Delete Line
If you select an event statement shown under Event Syntax / User Data, then select Delete Line from the Edit Menu, that line will be deleted from the event you are editing.

##### Add Line to condition/action
You can add more line(s) to a condition or action by first selecting a condition or action statement under Event Syntax / User Data, then select Add Line to condition/action from the Edit Menu.

##### Add Statement
You can add more event commands to the event you are editing by selecting Add Statement from the Edit Menu.  A selection of common valid event commands are then popped up for you to select.  Some advanced Trick commands, such as trick.remove_event(), can only be added manually after you have "stubbed-out" a new event via MTV.
