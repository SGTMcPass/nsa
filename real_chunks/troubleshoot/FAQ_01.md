## What is Trick?
Trick is a simulation environment and toolkit that allows users to create complex physics simulations.

## Why should I use Trick?
You should use Trick if you want to develop an accurate physics simulation without needing to develop core simulation capabilities manually.

## What operating systems can Trick run on?
Trick currently runs on all System V and POSIX compliant UNIX operating systems. MacOSX and most Linux distributions fall under this umbrella.

### Does Trick run on Windows?
Trick does not run natively on Windows, however it *is* possible to run Trick on the Windows 10 Linux Subsystem. Trick will not be ported to Windows until Windows is POSIX compliant, which is highly unlikely.

### What are the differences between Trick versions?
Trick 15 marked the first iteration of an open source Trick Simulation Environment. Trick 17 has several bug fixes, new features, and is currently in active development; it should be used for all new simulation development.

## Can Trick interact with other applications?
Trick is capable of interacting with other applications via the variable server; the variable server contains the values of a simulation which can then be sent over TCP/IP to a client application.

### MATLAB/Simulink
MathWorks developed a package to generate Trick friendly code from their models. An introduction video on Trick-MATLAB/Simulink interfacing can
