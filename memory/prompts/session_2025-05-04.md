Topic: Deep Prompt Engineering for Aerospace Simulation + Assistant Profile Upgrade
Date: 2025-05-04
Version: Prompt Engineer v1.0
```

**Key Concepts:**

- Created a structured `#deepdive` prompt for generating AI-assisted research
  reports on the latest prompt engineering techniques
- Included foundational and recent research (2020â€“2025) with practical
  application to Trick, GNC, CI/CD, and simulation tooling
- Integrated **chain-of-thought reasoning** and **accuracy-over-speed
  principles** into prompts
- Updated NASA Simulation Assistant profile to reflect enhanced reasoning
  standards
- Provided full exports in **JSON, Markdown, and YAML** formats
- Discussed the impact of formatting, fenced blocks, and emojis on model
  behavior
- Clarified when Markdown/structure helps the model vs. human readability

**Code Artifact:**
